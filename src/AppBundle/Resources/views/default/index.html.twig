    <p> The Women’s Print History Project 1750-1836 (WPHP) is the first 
        comprehensive bibliographical database of women's contributions to print 
        for one of the most convulsive periods in the history of both women’s 
        writing and print. The database, with nearly 2,000 person entries and over 
        8,000 title entries, will enable rigorous quantitative analysis of patterns
        in women's print history.</p>
